## Tools

- \#2 Phillips screwdriver
- 1/8" flat screwdriver
- Small curved pick or paperclip recommended
- Contact cleaning spray (I used CRC QD Contact Cleaner)
- Fine wet/dry sandpaper (I used 800 grit 3M Wetordry)
- Light dialectric/lithium grease to lubricate parts

## Steps

- Remove window switch from door handle:
	- Use flat screwdriver to pry off the speaker grille and the plugs covering the two main handle screws
	- Remove 4 Phillips screws holding on the door handle
	- Disconnect window switch connector
	- Remove screws holding the switch to the bezel and unclip from bezel  
- Disassemble window switch:
	- There are a lot of small parts and springs that fall out when you start taking this apart, so do this on a clean table where small parts cannot be easily lost.
	- To access the contacts themselves, we must remove both rocker switches and the top cover to the housing. 
	- Using flat screwdriver, pry off clear plastic housing
	- Remove passenger switch by pulling it straight off
	- The driver switch is a bit difficult, you have to pry on both tabs holding the metal pivot pin to remove it. Helps to have three hands. There are two spring loaded plungers underneath the switch so be careful not to lose them.
	- Removing the driver switch gives you access to two screws required to remove the top cover.
	- Remove those two screws and the rest of the screws holding the top cover on
	- The hardest part of removing the top cover is the window lock button. Once the top cover comes off, the springs in the window lock button want to come flying apart.
	- Carefully lift the top cover vertically
	- The passenger rocker switch thing and the window lock button parts will fall out
	- Remove the screws holding the LED panel on and remove it
