# AC Restoration
### Oct 25 2021

## Background:

My AC system never cooled very effectively, and the low-pressure line from the evaporator core was badly smashed in from the previous owner. Likely from the power steering pump during engine removal or installation. Since I live in Florida having A/C is a must so I decided to overhaul the A/C system. These are the steps I took to convert my A70 from R12 to R134. I put in the effort to replace what 30-year old parts I could so I have the best chance of a cold and reliable A/C system. 

## Documents: 
You mainly need to follow the [Toyota TSRM](http://www.cygnusx1.net/Supra/Library/TSRM/MK3/manual.aspx?S=AC&P=1) and [Toyota TSB for R12 Retrofit](http://tms.cleanautoalliance.org/documents/ac002t98.pdf) which only specifies to replace the receiver/drier, receiver/drier O-rings, compressor plate O-rings, and compressor suction and discharge O-rings. Most of the part numbers listed in this document are discontinued, so I have listed alternatives in the Parts section. I opted to replace every O-ring and every component except the pressure switches and condenser. 

The following parts are applicable to all 1986-1992 MA70 models. For JZ swaps, you'll need to find the correct compressor and lines on your own.

I would have swapped the condenser too but I could not find a replacement. Denso 477-0136 or 477-0145 are listed as fitting 1986 and 1987 models and from the sparse pictures available they did not look like my condenser. There is debate over the efficiency of R134 in condensers intended for R12, the former usually being a parallel-flow design and the latter using a serpentine tube design. Upgrading to a thicker parallel flow condenser will result in better cooling efficiency, but as of this writing I don't think any specific parallel flow condenser exists for the A70, it would have to be custom made and lines adapted. It did exist at one point though. [Recent Supraforums Thread](https://www.supraforums.com/threads/source-for-parallel-flow-a-c-condenser.1074449/)   

## Tools:

- General hand tools (sockets, wrenches, screwdrivers)
- 14mm and 17mm flare wrench and flare crow's foot highly recommended. A 17mm crow's foot is needed to remove receiver/drier without having to remove the entire condenser, there's no clearance to swing a regular wrench otherwise.  
- 22mm wrench or adjustable wrench for large evaporator fitting in the engine bay
- 8mm impact socket for compressor plate. Or 8mm wrench and a hammer
- 5mm Allen/internal hex for expansion valve bolts

## Steps:

### Evacuate R12

I had to call several shops in order to find one in my area that had the equipment to evacuate R12. All the A/C specific shops didn't have it and I didn't bother calling any auto repair chains. I ended up finding Orlando Import Auto Specialists that had the equipment. They told me my R12 charge was low. They evacuated my R12, converted the fittings, charged it with PAG oil and R134 and tested for leaks, then took the R134 back out since I told them I would be replacing components myself. Cost of this was $80.

The order of the following steps is not that important, the only order that is important is that the receiver/dryer should be the last component installed and the system sealed afterwards to avoid the dryer absorbing moisture from the air.

### Lines

Here are all the lines with o-rings that should be replaced. Some are already included in the subsequent steps, this is the complete list. Also includes the torque specs.

- Evaporator lines: 10 o-rings total. 4 inside the evaporator box for the evaporator -> expansion valve -> lines connections (**A**), 2 for the unions to the lines at the firewall (**B**), 2 for the union of the evaporator lines to the condensor and compressor (**C** and **D**) and 2 for the pressure switches (**I**)
- Compressor: 4 o-rings total. 2 for the suction and pressure lines that attach to the compressor (**H**), 2 for the other side of those lines from the evaporator and condenser (**F** and **G**)
- Receiver/drier: 4 total. 2 o-rings for the inlet and outlet (**E**) and 2 for the lines that connect to the evaporator line and condensor (**C**). 

In my case I also replaced the two smashed evaporator lines in the engine bay with used ones that were in much better condition. Having the radiator and intercooler piping out made this easy.  

I have circled the location of the areas with o-rings:

### Evaporator and Expansion Valve

It is not necessary to replace the evaporator. However, I would recommend taking the box out anyways to clean out 30 years of dirt and replace the o-rings and the expansion valve to the R134 specific ones in the parts list.  

[TSRM Pages](http://www.cygnusx1.net/Supra/Library/TSRM/MK3/manual.aspx?S=AC&P=34)

- Follow the service manual instructions. Remove the glovebox, lower support bar and trim, footwell trim, and ECU. 
- Remove the screws and nuts and electrical connector for the temp sensor thermistor). The connector is a real PITA to get apart, WD40 and a small screwdriver recommended to get it loose.
- Disconnect the line fittings in the engine bay and gently pull and wiggle the evaporator box towards you so the lines pull through the firewall. Spraying some silicone lubricant in the grommet will help the lines slide out more easily.
- Don't forget about the drain tube. Silicone lubricant will help it slide out of the grommet easily, but you can also leave it in the grommet and just pull it off the barb on the evaporator box instead.
- There was wet dirt, twigs, and leaves inside of my evaporator core since Toyota didn't start adding cabin air filters to all models until the 2000s. Remove the screws and clips and the two halves of the evaporator will come apart. 
- Don't lose the temperature thermistor.
- Wash out the box, making sure to keep the gray foam inside since we will need to reuse it.
- Wash the outside of the evaporator and lines. The service manual says to only use air and not water to clean the evaporator, which I find odd since the evaporator gets covered in water anyways.
- Replace the foam, take a few pictures before so you know where to apply it. Thankfully the adhesive backing is soft and came off pretty easily, if you roll the edge first before pulling it will come off in one piece.
- Once it is clean, use a 5mm internal hex wrench to remove the two screws holding the lines and expansion valve to the evaporator. The screws themselves were covered in corrosion and gunk so I cleaned them with a wire wheel. 
- Install new o-rings and expansion valve, being sure to coat the new rings in refrigerant oil. Torque screws to **5 nm / 4 ft-lb**. I also applied anti-seize.
- Plug the lines to reduce internal exposure to moisture, only unsealing them on final reassembly.
- Reinstall evaporator core and lines back into the box, don't forget to reinstall the foam and temperature thermistor.  
- Reverse removal procedure to reinstall. Don't forget to reconnect the temp thermistor and drain tube. 

Side note: to clean and maintain your evaporator box for this and any other car, Toyota has a foaming A/C Refresher Kit that you spray into the evaporator via the drain tube to clean out mold and dirt and shit and help freshen up the smell. You can buy something similar from other manufacturers as well, I know Subaru also has the same kit.

### Compressor

Whether or not you replace the compressor, the O-rings should be replaced with the green R134 ones. Both the o-rings for the hoses and under the plate the hoses attach to. The new Denso 471-1250 compressor comes with o-rings, but they are black and the compressor is intended for R12. So to be on the safe side, replace them. When installing a new compressor, the service fitting plate from your old compressor must be swapped to the new one since the new compressor does not come with this plate. So you might as well swap to known-R134-compatible o-rings. 

The TSRM covers removing the compressor, but not removing the service plate and o-rings. The Denso new compressor instructions **do** cover this, so see [here](https://www.densoproducts.com/denso-471-1250-new-ac-compressor-with-clutch). If installing a new compressor I would follow the instructions that came with it first. 

- You don't need to remove the compressor if you're reusing your old one, the O-rings can be swapped in-place. I would recommend removing it though to keep out dirt. 
- Clean the top of the compressor of dirt so it does not fall into the compressor
- Using a 12mm socket, remove the suction and pressure hoses. Tape them up so you don't get dirt in them, and plug the openings to the compressor as well.
- Using an 8mm socket (impact socket recommended), remove the plate. These bolts are pretty tight, they have 8mm heads but are 8mm x 1.25 bolts. I stripped the first one because I was using a 3/8" 8mm chrome socket on my 3/8" impact and it cracked, so don't do that. Use a stronger impact socket. Even when I tried to do it by hand with a ratchet, my 8mm sockets themselves stripped and slipped on the fasteners. I didn't have an 8mm impact socket so I used a 8mm box end wrench and a hammer and that was able to break the stubborn ones loose.  
- Swap o-rings, being sure to coat them in refrigerant oil and ensure no dirt is on the sealing surface
- Torque the four plate bolts to **25 nm / 18 ft-lb**


### Receiver/Drier

This is kind of a pain. There is no clearance to get an open end wrench in and turn the line fittings for the drier without pulling the condenser out. I was able to break the fittings loose using a 17mm crow's foot, it just barely had enough clearance to turn. Thankfully they were not super tight, I soaked them with PB Blaster first. Removing the bumper bar makes this easier. In hindsight, I should have just removed the condenser. 

[TSRM Pages](http://www.cygnusx1.net/Supra/Library/TSRM/MK3/manual.aspx?S=AC&P=28)

- Using 17mm crow's foot wrench, remove the two lines at the top of the drier. 
- Using a 10mm socket, undo the two clamps holding the drier in. Only loosen them enough to release the drier, they are a bit annoying to put back if they come off completely.
- Slide the old drier down and out
- Remove old o-rings and install new ones that came with the drier, make sure to coat them in refrigerant oil
- Slide new drier in, remove the caps and reinstall fittings, torquing to **5 nm / 4 ft-lb**
- TSRM specifies that **20cc** of refrigerant oil be added to the compressor when the receiver/drier is replaced.
